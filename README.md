### Project Title
bikeshare

### Description
bikeshare helps you discover data gathered by a US bike-sharing company named Motivate.

### Getting started
Run bikeshare.py in the Python interpreter of your choice. Just make sure you have Python version 3.8.5 or later running and access to Pandas and Numpy.

### Usage
Right after starting you will be asked three simple questions to filter the data you want to explore:
1. city
2. month
3. weekday

You can choose a city from Chicago, New York City, Washington and you might want to see details only for a specific month or a specific weekday. After making your choices you will see the data analysis broken down into the following sections:
- time stats
- station stats
- trip duration stats
- user stats

Each section will provide you with information about calculation duration.

At the end of an iteration you will be asked if you want to restart or leave the program.

### Files used
* chicago.csv
